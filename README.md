# CustomTextViewDemo

This is a sample app that uses [SSYDragDestinationTextView] to implement a text view that allows files to dragged onto it. Additionally it introduces the category NSTextView+EditWithUndo that allows for easy programmatic editing of an NSTextView’s text without forgoing undo support for the changes.
